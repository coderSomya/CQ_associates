Agenda:
Data Handling and Functions

Members present:
Secretaries (01): Somyajeet Chowdhury

Members Absent:
Associates (05): G Abhinav Reddy, Gaurav Jindal, Aneesh Raghav, Olivia Pal, Shreya Shill

Points Discussed:

1. Discussion about “scopes” through an example explaining how local variable value overwrites the initially declared value.
2.	Prints “undefined” if a variable that is not declared is used in console.log.
3.	If a function does not find a particular variable within its scope, it searches for it one step outside.
4.	While reading the code for the first time, the compiler assigns scope of global to functions or variables.
5.	When a function is called, it goes inside and gives the variable within it the scope of that function.
6.	Discussion about “type conversion” and implicit and explicit type conversions.
7.	Discussion about different data types: string, number, undefined, NaN, boolean 
8.	Discussion about concatenation between number and string.
9.	NaN: Not a Number, when the compiler cannot come to a particular type.
10.	=== means strict equality. It not only compares values, but also types.
11.	== will give true even if 1="1" is compared.
12.	Empty string gets converted into false, rest any string gets converted into true.
13.	0==-0 gives true value, while 1==-1 gives false.
14.	Discussion about significance of -0.
15.	Recap of Event Listeners and discussion on further concepts.
16.	Introduction to Data handling.
17.	Discussion about data handling in arrays, example: push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.
18.	Discussion about how to access object and its properties.
19.	Discussion about map and filter function.

1. Revise and go through everything that was taught.
